**Project Scope**:

Some hotshot media mogul has heard of your newly acquired skills in Java. They have contracted you and a friend to
stride on the edge of copyright glory and start re-making iTunes, but under a different name. They have spoken to
lawyers and are certain a working prototype should not cause any problems and ensured that you will be safe. The
lawyer they use is the same that Epic has been using, so they are familiar with Apple.
The second part of the assignment deals with manipulating SQL data in Spring using a the JDBC with the PostgreSQL
driver. For this part of the assignment, you are given a database to work with. It is called Chinook. You need to first
create the database in PgAdmin, then open a query tool and drag the script in and run it. It should generate all the tables
and populate it.
Chinook models the iTunes database of customers purchasing songs. You are to create a Spring Boot application, include
the correct driver, and create a repository pattern to interact with the database.


**Project Stack**: 

Springboot + Maven is used to build this project.

**Project Dependencies**:

1. JDBC (for writing the sql queries to interact with database)
2. Lombok (for removing the boilerplate code of getters, setters, and constructors kind of stuff)
3. PostgresSQL (for the connection with database)

**Project Requirements**:

1. Intellij Ultimate 
2. Postgres and PgAdmin 
3. Java 17 
4. Postgres SQL driver dependency
